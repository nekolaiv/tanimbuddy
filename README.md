# 🌾 TanimBuddy

**TanimBuddy** is an AI-powered, SMS-based agricultural advisory system designed to support smallholder Filipino farmers using basic mobile phones. It provides personalized, localized, and timely farming recommendations in native dialects — no smartphone or internet required.

Powered by a lightweight AI engine called **BantayANI** (Artificial Narrow Intelligence), TanimBuddy brings essential farming knowledge straight to the farmer’s inbox via text. It acts as a digital *barangay agri aide* — always available, kind, and practical.
